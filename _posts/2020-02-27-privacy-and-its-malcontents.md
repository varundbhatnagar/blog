### Why does privacy matter?

Data privacy has been a common conversation topic among the general public since the Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2018. The data "breach," where user information was hoovered up through a Facebook quiz and subsequently misrepresented as being used for academic purposes, resulted in over $5bn in fines for Facebook. However, users may be surprised to learn that Facebook's infringements were, in fact, relatively narrow in scope (but nonetheless egregious) compared to the growing remit of privacy law. Enterprises with wide-spanning data practices should be wary when establishing data-gathering practices, particularly those practices which are covered by the California Consumer Protection Act.

### Privacy, past and present

Privacy law and ethics stretches back to the 1600s in the United States, when Governor William Bradford opened up mail flowing between the US colonies and England to monitor insurrectionary forces in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Townshend Acts of 1768 allowed British tax agents to search colonist homes, and served as the motivation behind the Fourth Amendment within the Bill of Rights, which laid out the definition of a lawful search. Since then, innovations within the postal services, telegraph, and photography have provoked conversations over what level of government snooping ought be considered an overreach. However, these days, corporations (as opposed to governments) are coming under the popular/regulatory microscope.
