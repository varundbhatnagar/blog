### Why does privacy and governance matter?

Data privacy has been a common conversation topic among the general public since the Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2018. The data "breach," where user information was hoovered up through a Facebook quiz and subsequently misrepresented as being used for academic purposes, resulted in over $5bn in fines for Facebook. However, users may be surprised to learn that Facebook's infringements were, in fact, relatively narrow in scope (but nonetheless egregious) compared to the growing remit of privacy law. Enterprises with wide-spanning data practices should be wary when establishing data-gathering practices, particularly those practices which are covered by the California Consumer Protection Act and EU General Data Protection Act.

Companies have already begun complying with these regulations, primarily in the form of updated privacy notices. However, precedence has yet to be set around how data governance (oversight of data flows both within and outside the company) is treated in this process. This article will deal with that intersection. 

### What laws are actually on the books? What are their implications to my business?

There are a couple new laws that directly pertain to company data usage, most prominently GDPR and CCPA. GDPR requires companies that "process" (a purposefully broad term that covers just about anything you can do with data: collection, storage, transmission, analysis, etc.) any personal data of EU citizens must comply with a <a href="{{ https://gdpr.eu/checklist/ }}">{{ 19-point checklist. }}</a> 

The CCPA mandate covers any for-profit entity that collects consumers' personal data, which does business in California, and satisfies at least one of the following thresholds:

    Has annual gross revenues in excess of $25 million;
    Buys or sells the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers or households; or
    Earns more than half of its annual revenue from selling consumers' personal information.

Organizations are required to "implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices"[11] in protecting consumer data. 

### Privacy, past and present

Privacy law and ethics stretches back to the 1600s in the United States, when Governor William Bradford opened up mail flowing between the US colonies and England to monitor insurrectionary forces in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Townshend Acts of 1768 allowed British tax agents to search colonist homes, and served as the motivation behind the Fourth Amendment within the Bill of Rights, which laid out the definition of a lawful search. Since then, innovations within the postal services, telegraph, and photography have provoked conversations over what level of government snooping ought be considered an overreach. However, these days, private institutions (as opposed to governments) are coming under the popular/regulatory microscope. 

The laws above have pressing implications upon data governance practices, as well as the activities peripheral to the governance function. (AI & machine learning, automation, data
